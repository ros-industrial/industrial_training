/* CREATE PICK MOVES
  Goal:
    - Set the pose for the tcp at the box pick.
    - Create tcp poses for the pick motions (approach, target, retreat).
    - Find transform of the wrist in tcp coordinates
    - Convert tcp pick poses to wrist poses.
         * Moveit's kinematics require the target position to be specified relative to
           one of the kinematic links of the manipulator arm (as defined in the SRDF)

  Hints:
    - You can manipulate the "world_to_tcp_tf" transform through the "setOrigin" and "setRotation".
    - Look into the "create_manipulation_poses" function and observe how each pick pose is created.
    - Use the "transform_from_tcp_to_wrist" function to populate the "wrist_pick_poses" array.
