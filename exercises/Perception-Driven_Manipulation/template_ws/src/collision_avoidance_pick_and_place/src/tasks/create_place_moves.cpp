/*    CREATE PLACE MOVES
  Goal:
    - Set the pose of the tcp at the box place pose
    - Create tcp poses for the place motion (approach, release, retreat).
    - Find transform of the wrist in tcp coordinates
    - Convert tcp pick poses to wrist poses.
         * MoveIt's kinematics require the target position to be specified relative to
           one of the kinematic links of the manipulator arm (as defined in the SRDF)

  Hints:
    - You can manipulate the "world_to_tcp_tf" transform through the "setOrigin" and "setRotation".
    - Use the "create_manipulation_poses" function to create the tcp poses between each place move
    - Use the "transform_from_tcp_to_wrist" function to populate the "wrist_place_poses" array.

   * - cfg.BOX_PLACE_TF is a tf::Transform object so it provides a getOrigin() method.
