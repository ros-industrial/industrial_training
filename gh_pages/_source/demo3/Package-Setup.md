# Package Setup
In this exercise, we'll build our package dependencies and configure the package for the Qt Creator IDE. 


## Import Workspace into QT
1) In QT do the following:
```
File -> New -> Other Project -> ROS Workspace
```
2) Fill the Project Name and Location information

* Name:  ```pick_and_place```
* Distribution: ```melodic```
* Build System: ```CatkinTools```
* Workspace Path ```~/optimized_planning_ws```

3) Click next to go to the summary and leave version control to defaults

4) With the project open, type ctrl+b to build the project. By building the project through QT Creator, it allows the IDE to enable features like autocomplete effectively.
