# Inspect the "pick_and_place_exercise" Package
>In this exercise, we will get familiar with all the files that you'll be interacting with throughout these exercises. 

## Acquire and initialize the Workspace
```
cp -r ~/industrial_training/exercises/Perception-Driven_Manipulation/template_ws ~/perception_driven_ws
cd ~/perception_driven_ws
source /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash
catkin init
```

## Download debian dependencies
>Make sure you have installed and configured the [rosdep tool](http://wiki.ros.org/rosdep).
>Then, run the following command from the `src` directory of your workspace.
```
rosdep install --from-paths . --ignore-src -y
```

## Build your workspace
```
catkin build --cmake-args -G 'CodeBlocks - Unix Makefiles'
```
>If the build fails then revisit the previous two steps to make sure all the dependencies were downloaded.


## Source the workspace
> Run the following command from your workspace parent directory
```
source devel/setup.bash
```

## Locate and navigate into the package
```
cd ~/perception_driven_ws/src/collision_avoidance_pick_and_place/
```

## Look into each file in the launch directory
```
ur5_setup.launch     : Brings up the entire ROS system (MoveIt!, rviz, perception, ROS-I drivers, robot I/O peripherals)
ur5_pick_and_place.launch   : Runs your pick and place node.
```

## Look into the config directory

```
ur5/
 - pick_and_place_parameters.yaml    : List of parameters read by the pick and place node.
 - rviz_config.rviz   : Rviz configuration file for display properties.
 - target_recognition_parameters.yaml    : Parameters used by the target recognition service for detecting the box from the sensor data.
 - test_cloud_obstacle_descriptions.yaml    : Parameters used to generate simulated sensor data (simulated sensor mode only)
 - collision_obstacles.txt   : Description of each obstacle blob added to the simulated sensor data (simulated sensor mode only)
```

## Look into the src directory

```
nodes:
 - pick_and_place_node.cpp : Main application thread. Contains all necessary headers and function calls.

tasks: Source files with incomplete function definitions.  You will fill with code where needed in order to complete the exercise.
 - create_motion_plan.cpp
 - create_pick_moves.cpp 
 - create_place_moves.cpp
 - detect_box_pick.cpp
 - pickup_box.cpp
 - place_box.cpp
 - move_to_wait_position.cpp
 - set_attached_object.cpp
 - set_gripper.cpp

utilities:  
 - pick_and_place_utilities.cpp : Contains support functions that will help you complete the exercise.
```
