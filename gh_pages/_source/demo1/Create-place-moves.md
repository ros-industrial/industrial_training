# Create Place Moves
>The gripper moves through three poses in order to place the box: Approach, place and retreat. In this exercise, we will create these place poses for the _tcp_  coordinate frame and then transform them to the arm's wrist coordinate frame.

## Locate Function

  * In the main program , locate the function call to `application.create_place_moves()`.
  * Go to the source file of that function by clicking in any part of the function and pressing "F2".
  * Remove the fist line containing the following `ROS_ERROR_STREAM ...` so that the program runs.

## Complete Code

  * Find every line that begins with the comment `Fill Code: ` and read the description.  Then, replace every instance of the comment  `ENTER CODE HERE`
 with the appropriate line of code
```
/* Fill Code:
     .
     .
     .
*/
/* ========  ENTER CODE HERE ======== */
```

 * The box's position at the place location is saved in the global variable `cfg.BOX_PLACE_TF`.

 * The `create_manipulation_poses()` uses the values of the approach and retreat distances in order to create the corresponding poses at the desired target.

 * Since moveit plans the robot path for the arm's wrist, then it is necessary to convert all the place poses to the wrist coordinate frame.

 * The [lookupTransform](http://docs.ros.org/melodic/api/tf/html/c++/classtf_1_1Transformer.html#a14536fe915c0c702534409c15714aa2f) method can provide the pose of a target relative to another pose.

## Build Code and Run

  * Compile the pick and place node:
     * In QtCreator: `Build -> Build Project`

     * Alternatively, in a terminal:
```
catkin build --cmake-args -G 'CodeBlocks - Unix Makefiles' --workspace collision_avoidance_pick_and_place
```

  * Run your node with the launch file:
```
roslaunch collision_avoidance_pick_and_place ur5_pick_and_place.launch
```
  * The tcp and wrist position at the place location will be printed on the terminal. You should see something like:
```
