# Detect Box Pick Point
>The coordinate frame of the box's pick can be requested from a ros service that detects it by processing the sensor data. In this exercise, we will learn how to use a service client to call that ros service for the box pick pose.

## Locate Function

  * In the main program, locate the function call to `application.detect_box_pick()`.
  * Go to the source file of that function by clicking in any part of the function and pressing "F2".
  * Remove the first line containing the following `ROS_ERROR_STREAM ...` so that the program runs.


## Complete Code

  * Find every line that begins with the comment `Fill Code: ` and read the description.  Then, replace every instance of the comment  `ENTER CODE HERE`
 with the appropriate line of code
```
/* Fill Code:
     .
     .
     .
*/
/* ========  ENTER CODE HERE ======== */
```

  * The `target_recognition_client` object in your programs can use the `call()` method to send a request to a ros service.

  * The ros service that receives the call will process the sensor data and return the pose for the box pick in the service structure member `srv.response.target_pose`.

## Build Code and Run

  * Compile the pick and place node:
     * in QTCreator: `Build -> Build Project`

     * Alternatively, in a terminal:
```
catkin build --pkg collision_avoidance_pick_and_place
```

  * Run your node with the launch file:
```
roslaunch collision_avoidance_pick_and_place ur5_pick_and_place.launch
```
  * A blue box and voxel grid obstacles will be displayed in rviz. In the terminal you should see a message like the following:
```
