# Open Gripper
>In this exercise, the objective is to use a "grasp action client" to send a grasp goal that will open the gripper.

## Locate Function

  * In the main program, locate the function call to `application.set_gripper()`.
  * Go to the source file of that function by clicking in any part of the function and pressing "F2".
  * Remove the fist line containing the following `ROS_ERROR_STREAM ...` so that the program runs.


## Complete Code

  * Find every line that begins with the comment `Fill Code: ` and read the description.  Then, replace every instance of the comment  `ENTER CODE HERE`
 with the appropriate line of code.
```
/* Fill Code:
     .
     .
     .
*/
/* ========  ENTER CODE HERE ======== */
```

 * The `grasp_goal.goal` property can take on three possible values:
```
    grasp_goal.goal = object_manipulation_msgs::GraspHandPostureExecutionGoal::GRASP;
    grasp_goal.goal = object_manipulation_msgs::GraspHandPostureExecutionGoal::RELEASE;
    grasp_goal.goal = object_manipulation_msgs::GraspHandPostureExecutionGoal::PRE_GRASP;
```

  * Once the grasp flag has been set you can send the goal through the grasp action client


## Build Code and Run

  * Compile the pick and place node:
     * in QTCreator: `Build -> Build Project`

     * Alternatively, in a terminal:
```
catkin build collision_avoidance_pick_and_place
```

  * Run your node with the launch file:
```
roslaunch collision_avoidance_pick_and_place ur5_pick_and_place.launch
```

  * If the task succeeds you will see something like the following in the terminal (below). The robot will not move, only gripper I/O is triggered:
```
[ INFO] [1400553290.464877904]: Move wait Succeeded
[ INFO] [1400553290.720864559]: Gripper opened
[ERROR] [1400553290.720985315]: detect_box_pick is not implemented yet.  Aborting.
```
