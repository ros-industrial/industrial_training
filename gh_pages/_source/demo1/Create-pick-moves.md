# Create Pick Moves
> The gripper moves through three poses in order to do a pick: Approach, target and retreat. In this exercise, we will use the box pick transform to create the pick poses for the TCP (Tool Center Point) coordinate frame and then transform them to the arm's wrist coordinate frame

## Locate Function

  * In the main program , locate the function call to `application.create_pick_moves()`.
  * Go to the source file of that function by clicking in any part of the function and pressing "F2".
  * Remove the fist line containing the following `ROS_ERROR_STREAM ...` so that the program runs.

## Complete Code

  * Find every line that begins with the comment `Fill Code: ` and read the description.  Then, replace every instance of the comment  `ENTER CODE HERE`
 with the appropriate line of code
 ```
/* Fill Code:
     .
     .
     .
*/
/* ========  ENTER CODE HERE ======== */
```

 * The `create_manipulation_poses()` uses the values of the approach and retreat distances in order to create the corresponding poses at the desired target.

 * Since moveit plans the robot path for the arm's wrist, then it is necessary to convert all the pick poses to the wrist coordinate frame.

 * The [lookupTransform](http://docs.ros.org/melodic/api/tf/html/c++/classtf_1_1Transformer.html#a14536fe915c0c702534409c15714aa2f) method can provide the pose of a target relative to another pose.

## Build Code and Run

  * Compile the pick and place node
      * In QtCreator, use : `Build -> Build Project`

      * Alternatively, in a terminal:
```
catkin build --cmake-args -G 'CodeBlocks - Unix Makefiles' --pkg collision_avoidance_pick_and_place
source ./devel/setup.bash
```

  * Run your node with the launch file:
```
roslaunch collision_avoidance_pick_and_place ur5_pick_and_place.launch
```
  * The tcp and wrist position at the pick will be printed in the terminal. You should see something like this:
```
