Perception-Driven Manipulation Introduction
===========================================


Goal
----

  The purpose of these exercises is to implement a ROS node that drives a
  robot through a series of moves and actions in order to complete a pick and
  place task.  In addition, they will serve as an example as to how to integrate
  a variety of software capabilities (perception, controller drivers, I/O,
  inverse kinematics, path planning, collision avoidance, etc) into a
  ROS-based industrial application.  


Objectives
----------

* Understand the components and structure of a real or simulated robot
  application.
* Learn how to command robot moves using Moveit!.
* Learn how to move the arm to a joint or Cartesian position.
* Leverage perception capabilities including AR tag recognition and PCL.
* Plan collision-free paths for a pick and place task.
* Control robot peripherals such as a gripper.
