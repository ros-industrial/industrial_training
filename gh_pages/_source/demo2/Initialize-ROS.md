# Initialize ROS
>In this exercise, we'll initialize the ros components that our application needs in order to communicate to MoveIt! and other parts of the system.

## Locate Exercise Source File

  * Go to the main application source file located in `plan_and_run/src/plan_and_run_node.cpp`.
  * In the main program, locate the function call to `application.initRos()`. 
  * Go to the source file for that function located in the `plan_and_run/src/tasks/init_ros.cpp`.
     * _Alternatively, in QTCreator, click on any part of the function and press "F2" to bring up that file._
  * Comment out the first line containing the `ROS_ERROR_STREAM ...` entry so that the function doesn't quit immediately.

## Complete Code

 * Observe how the ros Publisher `marker_publisher_` variable is initialized.  The node uses it to publish a `visualization_msgs::!MarkerArray` message for visualizing the trajectory in RViz.
 * Initialize the `moveit_run_path_client_ptr_` action client with the `ExecuteTrajectoryAction`  type.

 * Find comment block that starts with `/*  Fill Code:` and complete as described.

 * Replace every instance of `[ COMPLETE HERE ]` accordingly.

## Build Code and Run

 * `cd` into your catkin workspace and run `catkin build`
 * Then run the application launch file:
```
roslaunch plan_and_run demo_run.launch
```
