/* PLAN AND RUN
  Goal:
    - Plan a robot path from a trajectory using the path planner
    - Observe how to modify the start and end points in the trajectory so that
      unique joint poses at those points are used instead.  Skipping this step would cause planning
      for multiple path possibilities (multiple combinations of start and end), which
      could take a very long time.

   * - Observe how the computed start_pose and end_pose joint poses are used to turn the start and end points
   *    in the trajectory to JointTrajectoryPts.
   * Hint:
   * - This manipulation of the trajectory allows guiding the planner so that the resulting path
   *    begins and ends near desirable joint configurations.  It also saves time by not having the
   *    planner search through potential path solutions whose start and end configurations are less adequate.
