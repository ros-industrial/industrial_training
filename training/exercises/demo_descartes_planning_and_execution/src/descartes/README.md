ROS-Industrial Special Project: Cartesian Path Planner

[René Descartes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes) _René Descartes (French: [ʁəne dekaʁt]; Latinized: Renatus Cartesius; adjectival form: "Cartesian"; 31 March 1596 – 11 February 1650) was a French philosopher, mathematician and writer who spent most of his life in the Dutch Republic. He has been dubbed The Father of Modern Philosophy, and much subsequent Western philosophy is a response to his writings, which are studied closely to this day._
